              Our agency partnered with Episode Six as the dedicated front-end
              team, to complement their in-house back-end developers. Below are

              The client requested a code cleanup due to inconsistent styling
              libraries, naming conventions, and incomplete TypeScript usage. I
              conducted an audit and proposed a unified coding standard.

              This project was particularly challenging for me, as I was tasked
              with leading it for a high-profile client despite not having a
              solid experience with React. Fortunately, my extensive background
              in VueJS helped, as both frameworks share similar concepts,
              allowing me to quickly get up to speed. The projectâ€™s scale,
              combined with the complexity of understanding payment platform
              systems and terminology, added to the challenge, but I found it
              enjoyable and gained valuable experience with React and other
              tools along the way.
