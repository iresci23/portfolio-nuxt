# A personal portfolio built with Nuxt 3 and deployed to Netlify.
 
My portfolio website that showcases some of the projects I worked on. 
My portfolio URL: https://irelene.dev/ 

I designed the site to be simple for both navigation and display.
Feel free to use the design template on your own portfolio.
